Writing standards for this repo (CLAUDE.md has the full statement):
1. Code — simple, idiomatic, easy for a human to follow. Prefer the boring construction.
2. Comments — terse, necessary, easy for a human to read. Say what the code cannot: the
   why, the invariant, the trap. Do not restate the code, and do not argue against
   alternatives the code does not contain.
3. Documentation — simple, concise, easy for a human to read.
Applies to hand-written source and docs, not generated output (codegen, lockfiles).
